# Factorio Script Extender

This was a small pet project to extend Factorio's LUA API.
You can use this is a small (and surely not ready for production!) framework.

## Things to fix:

* This code uses absolute paths. They will not work on your computer! Change them :)
* You need to clone this repo with `git clone --recursive` argument or do a `git submodule update` after a clone to recieve all submodules.
